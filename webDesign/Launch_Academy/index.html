                <div class="content" id="about">
                     <p>Hello Launch Academy!  My name is Chase Blokker, and I'm 23 years old.  Last year I received a major in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lmu.edu/">Loyola Marymount University</a>.  Through my EE coursework, I was slowly introduced to CS.  I enjoyed it enough to make it my minor.  But it wasn't until I took classes in <a href="https://github.com/cblokker/CMSI-370">Interaction Design</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cblokker/cmsi371/tree/master/homework">Computer Graphics</a> when I really fell in love with CS.  I realized that I loved javascript and the web space.  Therefore, after receiving my EE degree, I decided to pursue a major in CS, which I'm currently doing right now.</p>

                    <p>I know exactly what I want to do with CS, which is to become a full stack web developer.  Unfortunately, I feel that my CS curriculum doesn't fully expose me to the amazing modern web frameworks - like ruby on rails and backbone.js.  This is why I'm applying to Launch Academy, so I can quickly learn skills and best practices to become a kick ass web developer!</p>

                    <p>I also have an eye for design, which hopefully comes across in this website.  I enjoy discussing what makes a graphical user interface look beautiful and user-friendly.</p>

                    <p>I have some experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as some backend work in MongoDB, using the bottle.py web framework.</p>

                    <p>I have limited experience working in groups, and I believe this is my biggest hurdle.  Launch Academy will give me the opportunity to develop good pair programming practices, as well as help me learn about the agile development process.</p>


                    <p>I think all the above factors make me a perfect candidate for Launch Academy.  I have some coding experience with an eye for design, but I have a lot of room to grow with respect to working with groups and truly becoming confident in my full stack skills need to bundle all my knowledge together so I can learn how to build awesome modern web apps!</p>
